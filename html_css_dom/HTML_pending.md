## 1. What is HTML?

- Stands for **HyperText markup language**, is the standard language **used for creating web pages and web applications**.
- It **_<u>consists of a series of elements or tags which browsers use to render the visual appearance of web pages</u>_**.
- HTML elements **_<u>tell the browser how to display the content of web pages, including text, images, links and other features</u>_**.
- These **_elements are structured hierarchically to define the layout and structure_** of a web document.
- HTML allows for the embedding of scripts written in languages such as javascript, which affect the behavior of HTML webpages.
- It also enables the inclusion of CSS to define the look and layout of a document.

### 2. Explain the difference between HTML and XHTML.

- HTML and XHTML (eXtensible HyperText markup language) are both languages used to create and structure content on the web.

**<u>HTML</u>:**

- Standard Markup Language for creating web pages.
- **More Flexible Syntax:** HTML syntax is more lenient with regards to case sensitivity, closing tags, and quotes around attribute values. For example, it's generally acceptable in HTML to omit certain closing tags or to use attributes without quotes.
- **Based on SGML** (Standard Generalized Markup Language): Although HTML5 is defined as an independent language without reliance on SGML.
- **Error Handling**: Browsers are designed to be very forgiving of HTML errors, and will often **_<u>render HTML documents correctly even if they contain small syntax errors</u>_**.

**<u>XHTML</u>:**

- **A Reformulation of HTML as an XML Application:** XHTML was **_<u>developed to bring the rigor of XML to web pages</u>_**. XML (eXtensible Markup Language) **_is a stricter language_** designed for carrying data.
- **Strict Syntax Rules**: All elements must be properly nested, closed, and are case-sensitive. Attributes must be quoted, and documents must have a root element.
- **Compatibility with XML Tools**: Because XHTML is an application of XML, it can be used with other XML tools and specifications, such as XSLT (for transforming XML data), XPath (for navigating XML documents), and so on.
- **Requires Well-Formed Documents**: For a document to be considered XHTML, it must be well-formed according to XML rules. This means stricter error handling compared to HTML, where browsers will not render pages with XML syntax errors.

**<u>Key Differences</u>:**

- **Syntax and Error Handling**: XHTML is stricter, requiring well-formed code, whereas HTML is more flexible.
- **Compatibility**: XHTML aims for compatibility with XML tools and environments, which may be beneficial in certain development scenarios.
- **Adoption**: HTML is more widely used for web pages, especially with the advent of HTML5, which incorporates many of the web application features previously achievable only through XHTML.
