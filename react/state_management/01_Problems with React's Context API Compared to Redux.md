### Problems with React's Context API Compared to Redux


**1. Performance concerns**:

**<ins>Context</ins>:**

- `React Context` <ins>***can cause unnecessary re-renders if not used carefully***</ins>.
- **_When the context value changes_**, <ins>_all components consuming the context will re-render_</ins>, regardless of whether they need the updated value or not.

**<ins>Redux</ins>:**

- `Redux` has more fine-grained <ins>control over updates.</ins>
- Components connected to the Redux store <ins>**_can be configured to only re-render when specific parts of the state_**</ins> that they are interested in change.

**2. State Management Complexity**:
**<ins>Context</ins>:**

- <ins>Suitable for **simple to medium complexity** state management</ins>
- Context API can **_become cumbersome in large-scale applications_** where complex state interactions and multiple contexts are involved.

**<ins>Redux</ins>:**

- Redux provides a **more robust solution for large-scale** applications
- Its architecture, including actions, reducers, and middleware, **_helps manage complex state logic more efficiently_**.

---

**3. Debugging and DevTools**:
**<ins>Context</ins>:**

- React Context **_does not have built-in tools for debugging_**.
- You can't easily inspect the state changes or the flow of actions like you can in Redux.

**<ins>Redux</ins>:**

- **_The Redux DevTools Extension_**, allows for time-travel debugging, state inspection, and understanding the sequence of dispatched actions.

**4. Middleware and Side Effects**:
**<ins>Context</ins>:**

- Handling side effects (like API calls) isn't directly part of the Context API.
- You would need to integrate it with other solutions like hooks or custom middleware.

**<ins>Redux</ins>:**

- Redux has a robust ecosystem for handling side effects.
- **_Middleware like Redux Thunk or Redux Saga is designed to handle complex asynchronous logic and side effects_** in a more manageable and scalable way.

---

**5. Boilerplate and Learning Curve**:
**<ins>Context</ins>:**

- The Context API **_has less boilerplate compared to Redux_** and is generally easier to learn, making it a good choice for smaller applications

**<ins>Redux</ins>:**

- Has a steeper learning curve, It requires understanding of its core principles like reducers, actions, and the store.

---

**6. Scalability**:
**<ins>Context</ins>:**

- For very large applications, the Context API might become less manageable compared to Redux.

**<ins>Redux</ins>:**

- Redux is designed for scalability.
- Its architecture supports large-scale applications and makes state management predictable even as the application grows.
